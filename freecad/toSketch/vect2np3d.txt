Explanation
plane_map:
This dictionary maps the plane ("XY", "XZ", "YZ") to a lambda function that extracts the appropriate coordinates (x, y, or z) from a FreeCAD.Vector.
List Comprehension:
For each vector, the appropriate coordinates are extracted using the selected lambda function.
NumPy Array:
The resulting list of tuples is converted into a NumPy 2D array using np.array().
Validation:
If an invalid plane is passed, a ValueError is raised with helpful feedback.
Performance Optimization
For very large lists of vectors:

The current implementation is efficient as it directly uses list comprehension.
If memory or speed becomes a bottleneck, consider chunking the data or leveraging parallel processing.
This approach ensures a clean and flexible way to work with 2D projections of 3D vectors. Let me know if you need further customization!
