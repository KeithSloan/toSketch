How It Works
Dynamic Segmentation:
Points are iteratively divided into segments when the fitting error exceeds a threshold (max_error).
B-Spline Fitting:
The splprep function creates a parameterized B-spline representation.
splev evaluates the spline to generate fitted points.
Residual Error:
The residual error is calculated as the mean Euclidean distance between the original and fitted points.
Curve Sampling:
The num_points_per_curve parameter determines the density of sampled points for each fitted curve.
Extending the Approach
Dynamic Thresholds:
Adjust max_error dynamically based on local curvature or noise.
Clustering:
Use clustering (e.g., K-means) to segment points into regions before fitting.
Parallelization:
Use multiprocessing or batch processing for very large datasets.
